## 2024-05-24 - Optimization of SkillSelector
**Learning:** Found redundant string allocation and `toLowerCase` computation inside nested `.map` and `.filter` loops in `SkillSelector.js`. The search term was being lowercased for every single skill, resulting in O(N*M) redundant operations.
**Action:** Extract `searchTerm.toLowerCase()` into a constant outside the loops. Measured a performance improvement in benchmarks for iterating over large skill lists. Always hoist constant computations outside of inner loops.
