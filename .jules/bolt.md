## 2024-05-24 - Optimization of SkillSelector Filtering
**Learning:** Performing string transformations like `.toLowerCase()` inside nested React `filter` / `map` loops is an O(N*M) anti-pattern that can severely impact the responsiveness of UI components with typing interactions (like a search bar).
**Action:** Always hoist static derivations (e.g., `searchTerm.toLowerCase()`) outside of nested iteration boundaries in hooks like `useMemo` to ensure they execute only once per recalculation.
**Learning:** Found redundant string allocation and `toLowerCase` computation inside nested `.map` and `.filter` loops in `SkillSelector.js`. The search term was being lowercased for every single skill, resulting in O(N*M) redundant operations.
**Action:** Extract `searchTerm.toLowerCase()` into a constant outside the loops. Measured a performance improvement in benchmarks for iterating over large skill lists. Always hoist constant computations outside of inner loops.
